## Problem: Power Plants in Goodland

Goodland is a country with several cities evenly spaced along a line. The distance between adjacent cities is one unit. There is a planning meeting for a power infrastructure project, and the government needs to know the smallest number of power plants needed to supply electricity to the entire list of cities. Determine this number. If this cannot be done, return `-1`.

### Problem Description

You are given a list of city data. Cities that can contain a power plant have been labeled `1`. Others not suitable for building a plant are labeled `0`. Given a distribution range of `k`, find the smallest number of plants that must be built so that all cities are served. The distribution range limits supply to cities where the distance is less than `k`.

### Example 

```
plaintext k = 3 arr = [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]
```
